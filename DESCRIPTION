Description: MicrobiotaProcess is an R package for analysis, visualization and 
    biomarker discovery of microbial datasets. It supports calculating alpha 
    index and provides functions to visualize rarefaction curves. Moreover, 
    it also supports visualizing the abundance of taxonomy of samples. And It 
    also provides functions to perform the PCA, PCoA and hierarchical cluster 
    analysis. More importantly, MicrobiotaProcess also provides a method for 
    the biomarker discovery of metagenome or other datasets.
